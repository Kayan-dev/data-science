NEW FALLOUT FROM CHERNOBYL; 
</p>
<p>
THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER BY DAVID R. MARPLES (ST. MARTIN'S 
PRESS: $35, CLOTH; $14.95, PAPER; 316 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-312-02432-0)

<p>
By James E. Oberg , Oberg, a space engineer in Houston, is the author of 
Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost (Random House). 
</p>
</byline>
<text>
<p>
The onset of the new Gorbachev policy of glasnost, commonly mistranslated as 
openness but closer in connotation to candor or publicizing, has complicated 
the task of Soviet secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new Western 
insights into Soviet society. David R. Marples' new book, his second on the 
Chernobyl accident of April 26, 1986, is a shining example of the best type of 
non-Soviet analysis into topics that only recently were absolutely taboo in 
Moscow official circles. 
</p>
<p>
The author, a British-educated historian and economist, is a research associate 
with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta, 
and the academic style of the book is undisguised. However, its intended 
audience is the general public, and anyone interested in nuclear power, or 
Soviet economy and society, or human drama, or just plain sleuthing state 
secrets, will find hitherto unpublished revelations and explanations of the 
event and its continuing aftermath. 
</p>
<p>
The effects of Chernobyl reverberated throughout so many facets of Soviet 
society that a continuous coherent narrative is probably impossible. Marples 
discusses half a dozen major themes arranged in a fairly arbitrary order (as 
indicated by the frequent and helpful cross references throughout the text) and 
succeeds in mapping out his main themes. The personal interests of each reader 
determine which of the sections may be deemed too detailed and which too 
sketchy, but considering the need for such a comprehensive overview, the levels 
are generally appropriate. 
</p>
<p>
The book is, on the one hand, not a light read, and an executive summary might 
have been possible in a quarter the length. But, on the other, so many of the 
judgments depend on a subtle interpretation of a multitude of sources that the 
author is obligated to present the raw data for the reader's inspection. The 
modular nature of the book also allows a reader to skip, browse, and revisit 
earlier sections, aided by a convenient internal organization and a thorough 
index. 
</p>
<p>
First in the world's attention, and in the text, is a discussion of the human 
victims of the accident. The official tally is 31 (only about 20 names have 
ever been released), but Marples suspects there were other short-term radiation 
victims. A large number of unnecessary late-term abortions were also performed 
on local women, and by rights those unborn babies count as casualties. 
Widespread "radiophobia" led to restricted diets which created malnourishment 
and subsequent disease in thousands of people. The tens of thousands of people 
taking part in cleanup operations were never included in official totals of 
those exposed. Since the book went to press, Soviet military sources have 
referred to at least one death in the actual reactor entombment program. 
</p>
<p>
But the greatest toll is likely to occur with the delayed deaths. Here, Marples 
encounters for the first time the soon familiar theme of official Soviet 
myth-making around the event: Reality is twisted to serve state policy 
objectives, which include calming an alarmed public with assurances that all is 
well when it isn't. 
</p>
<p>
And thus is born what he properly labels the "myth of Chernobyl," the official 
line that the disaster provided a test that Soviet society passed with honor. 
"In the Soviet view," he writes, "it was first and foremost a victory, a story 
with an ending, and an ending that was triumphant." 
</p>
<p>
Thus, when sober Western medical estimates placed the future "excess cancer 
deaths" at several tens of thousands, both in the Soviet Union and in Europe (a 
few tenths of a percent elevation of the natural cancer rate), the Soviets 
reacted furiously. The estimates are branded "nonsense" and the estimators are 
dismissed as "panic mongers" promulgating "anti-Soviet venom." 
</p>
<p>
Subsequently the author addresses themes of environmental impact, economic and 
political repercussions, public images, and the recovery operations. Along the 
way, Marples provides a damning list of examples in which Soviet officials 
attempted to retreat behind old-style cover-ups and outright lies. False 
information was issued on radiation levels, on subsequent accidents at the 
site, on contamination levels of the Kiev water supply, on severe discipline 
against non-volunteer cleanup personnel, on reactor entombment schedules and on 
operator training levels. 
</p>
<p>
A severe 1986-1987 countrywide electrical power shortage was officially denied 
although it was real enough to compel the restart of three Chernobyl reactors 
in explicit violation of Soviet safety regulations. Design deficiencies of the 
Chernobyl-style reactors were downplayed and human errors were declared to be 
the primary culprit. 
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, observes the author, "It is ironic that in an era of openness, 
Chernobyl may have been both the pioneer of glasnost under Gorbachev and then 
subsequently its first casualty." He ultimately concludes, "Aspects of the 
disaster . . . have rarely been dealt with thoroughly or even honestly by 
Soviet sources." Hence the need for this book, a need which is admirably 
fulfilled despite the many remaining mysteries and uncertainties. 
</p>
<p>
The July, 1987, trial of reactor personnel marked a full circle of disclosure. 
Journalists were allowed into the pre-scripted first and last days, but the 
weeklong deliberative sessions were held in secret and no word of their 
substance has ever been released. 
</p>
<p>
The propaganda purpose of the trial and surrounding official publicity, he 
maintains, had one goal: "To divert culpability from the party hierarchy, in 
Kiev and especially in Moscow." This is precisely the theme I have also 
encountered in my own investigations of aerospace accidents of the past. Where 
individual human failings led to catastrophe, a sanitized story may eventually 
be released, but where Kremlin policy led to disaster (such as the Nedelin 
catastrophe of 1960 or the Soyuz-1 disaster in 1967), the entire event remains 
absolutely off limits to glasnost. 
</p>
<p>
The closing blow-by-blow description of the nuclear power debate presages a 
dramatic event which occurred too recently for inclusion in this first edition. 
Viktor Legasov, tagged by the author as one of the country's two leading 
pro-nuclear advocates, actually was sinking into private despair over the poor 
implementation of safety standards. In the end, he made his final and most 
eloquent testimony to this despair on the second anniversary of the accident, 
by committing suicide. For several weeks the Soviets tried to sit on the 
circumstances of his "tragic death," even issuing official non-explanations 
which asserted that the death was not due to medical effects of radiation. 
Finally, crusading journalist Vladimir Gubarev, with access to Legasov's 
notebooks, broke the story in Pravda. Readers of this book will come to know 
these and other characters so well that the suicide fits right into the "big 
picture" of the catastrophe's social impacts. 
</p>
<p>
For an author to so accurately describe a social milieu that subsequent 
unpredictable events only enhance his insights is testimony to the highest 
quality of scholarship. Readers of Marples' book will rarely be surprised as 
the Chernobyl catastrophe's consequences continue to unfold in the future.

the construction of its concrete "sarcophagus" are, for obvious reasons, aerial 
photographs. Left, an artist's reconstruction of the reactor as it would have 
looked from the ground before the sarcophagus was in place. The point of view 
is the same as that of an official Soviet photograph, right, taken as the

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: WAITING FOR CHILDHOOD BY SUMNER LOCKE ELLIOTT (PERENNIAL 
LIBRARY/ HARPER &amp; ROW: $7.95)

<p>
Set in Australia at the turn of the 20th Century, "Waiting for Childhood" is 
the story of seven children left to cope for themselves after their parents 
die. Their father, The Rev. William Lord, expires at the breakfast table one 
morning. After the family leaves for a ramshackle house owned by a wealthy 
cousin, the mother loses her mind and then her life in an accident. 
</p>
<p>
The eldest daughter, Lily, takes charge of the entire household, as Jess 
becomes a favorite of her rich cousin Jackie and watches her rival for Jackie's 
affections fall fatally from a mountaintop. 
</p>
<p>
These characters, "all talented, all deeply human, (are) all so beautifully 
realized that by the end of the novel we identify with them to the point of 
heartbreak," Carolyn See wrote in these pages. " 'Waiting for Childhood' 
manages to be at once terribly melancholy and extraordinarily exhilarating."

'89 WISH LIST: PROTECTION, TAXES AND PEACE; 
</p>
<p>
SOCIAL BENEFITS, DEFICIT REDUCTION ARE TOP PRIORITIES FOR THE NEW YEAR 
</p>
</headline>
<text>
<p>
What changes would you like to see in business practices and the workplace this 
year? How can business leaders and economic policy-makers improve the economy 
and the world in general in 1989? The Times ran these questions by people in 
various walks of life, and here are some of their answers: 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Muriel Siebert, head of the Muriel Siebert &amp; Co. discount brokerage in New 
York, and first female member of the New York Stock Exchange: 
</p>
<p>
"I would like to see certain business practices regulated. I think that the 
leveraged buyouts show the greed of people at their worst. . . . The LBOs are 
bypassing the purpose of the capital-raising system. I think that to the extent 
that people were stockholders in these companies . . . they should be allowed 
to continue to have some kind of share in the profits (after the leveraged 
buyouts) because these moves were done while they were stockholders. 
</p>
<p>
"Must greed be the creed? I would like to see that also rolled over to our 
defense contractors. I am pro defense. I believe in a strong country because 
people mistake gentility for weakness. If (contractors) cheat on defense 
contracts, I don't see why they don't go to jail. . . . I just feel that if you 
are a major defense contractor, you owe a fiduciary responsibility to this 
country because defense expenditures are putting a pretty big toll on the 
country." 
</p>
<p>
Andrew Brimmer, former member of the Federal Reserve Board and head of a 
Washington economics consulting firm: 
</p>
<p>
"My leading wish is that the nation deal with the federal budget deficit. I 
would like to see a substantial reduction in 1989 and extending over the next 
three years. I would strongly recommend that we raise taxes. There should be 
some moderation in the level of government expenditures, but the real problem 
is the lag in revenue. 
</p>
<p>
"I also would like to see more done for education by business. The kind of 
education I'm talking about is at the elementary and secondary level. 
Businesses are already contributing to colleges. Businesses should do likewise 
for elementary and secondary schools. Business people can play a role as 
counselors and teachers. A firm might make available an engineer or 
mathematician to go into schools and teach. Business should do more to offer 
on-the-job training for unskilled, or limited-skills, people, perhaps through a 
(lower) learning wage. We would give business tax credits to do this." 
</p>
<p>
William R. Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation 
of Labor, AFL-CIO: 
</p>
<p>
"I would like to see a change in philosophy by the incoming President relating 
to labor relations and providing for fairness in our (labor) organizing efforts 
and contract negotiations. . . . 
</p>
<p>
"I would also like to see some protection for workers losing their jobs because 
of mergers. It is a national disgrace. In too many mergers, the workers are the 
ones that suffer and the country as well. Something should be done to correct 
it. . . . 
</p>
<p>
"And, finally, this Administration should face reality in resolving the 
astronomical deficit." 
</p>
<p>
Steven D. Lydenberg, an associate with the "socially responsible" investment 
firm of Franklin Research &amp; Development: 
</p>
<p>
"There is an increasing interest around the country in social investing. People 
want to know not just the financial implications of making a commitment in a 
company, but also the social implication. That information is not very easy to 
come by. 
</p>
<p>
"So, if at the end of '89 corporations were disclosing in a uniform way their 
yield figures, their charitable contribution figures, the numbers of women and 
minorities in top management and board directors, their attitude on a number of 
comparable social issues, I would be very happy." 
</p>
<p>
Frank Borman, chairman of Patlex Corp. of Chatsworth, former astronaut and 
former chairman of Eastern Airlines: 
</p>
<p>
"We should begin to move toward taxing consumption -- a value-added tax. This 
is quite controversial as Al Ullman (Oregon Democrat and former chairman of the 
House Ways and Means Committee, who was defeated in 1988 after advocating a 
value-added tax) will tell you. But this taxing system is needed. It would 
certainly help our exports. Almost all of Europe is under the value-added 
taxing system. Also, it may encourage saving instead of consumption. One of the 
ways you discourage consumption is to tax it." 
</p>
<p>
Michael Harrington, co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America and author of 
"The Other America" and "The New American Poverty": 
</p>
<p>
"I hope Secretary of State Baker will build on the basic insights of former 
Treasury Secretary Baker (James Baker, former treasury secretary, was nominated 
by President-elect Bush to be Secretary of State) that a settlement of Third 
World debt is in the self-interest of America, opening up markets for business 
and labor. But then the new Baker will have to go far beyond the old, since 
Latin America now owes more than it did in 1982 when the crisis officially 
began, and several countries, including Argentina and Brazil, may see democracy 
subverted if current trends persist. 
</p>
<p>
"At home, the nation must recognize that we can't waste young people, and 
particularly minorities and women, on illiteracy, unemployment and unproductive 
low-wage work. We must invest mightily in education, training and job 
generation." 
</p>
<p>
Alan Bromberg, a securities law expert and professor at Southern Methodist 
University: 
</p>
<p>
"There are several things I would like most to see changed in the economy and 
business practices. One, more concentration by business and government, both 
here and abroad, on . . . the facilitation of international trade and 
investment. This would require wider horizons for business people . . . and 
more effort by government to reduce and ultimately eliminate all kinds of 
restrictions on the movement of products. 
</p>
<p>
"Two, I would like to see a national consensus developed, preferably in the 
form of federal legislation, on corporate takeovers and buyouts that would 
recognize the efficiencies and benefits they bring as well as the dislocations 
and hardships they can cause. This would involve tax policies and labor polices 
and limitations on the ability of states to Balkanize corporate law by 
different anti-takeover statutes everywhere. (There also should be) some kind 
of limitation on management self-entrenchment and self-enrichment. 
</p>
<p>
"I think we could use a lot of clarification of the securities laws. I think 
the courts have done a good job of saying what insider trading is. The kind of 
issues that are most difficult are what really is parking (of stock)? How much 
cooperation or similar action by different individuals or different groups of 
individuals makes it collaboration? These issues haven't been well resolved. . 
. . 
</p>
<p>
Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace in Washington: 
</p>
<p>
"People now view threats to human security less in terms of political threats 
and more in environmental and economic terms. So for my wish list, I would ask 
first that we deal with the issue of the greenhouse effect. We better develop 
some alternative views in mass transportation and cut subsidies to reflect the 
true cost of fossil fuels in terms of pollution, along with the actual economic 
cost of development. Then, we could put more money into research and 
development of wind and solar energy. 
</p>
<p>
"(Also on my wish list is) peace on earth. If we want peace on earth, we have 
to start looking seriously at the fact that we are making more and more 
weapons, and in a process which endangers the health of American people. . . . 
Production plants have been proven to have released into the air and water 
radioactivity and toxic chemicals." 
</p>
<p>
"Also, it would be nice if we could learn that the rain forest affects all of 
us. We need to preserve it. And we would like the tuna industry to stop killing 
dolphins."
